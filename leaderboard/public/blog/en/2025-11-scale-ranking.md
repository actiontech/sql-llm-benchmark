# SCALE | November 2025 SQL Capability Leaderboard for Large Language Models

## I. Summary and Key Highlights

This edition of SCALE[1] evaluation focuses on the practical applications of next-generation professional-grade large language models in the SQL domain.

The core highlight of this release is the first in-depth evaluation reports of Gemini 3 Pro[2] and DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp[3], aiming to provide users with the most cutting-edge and reliable technology selection basis.

Key highlights:

1. **Top Contenders**: Gemini 3 Pro secured the championship in "SQL Understanding" with a leading score of **86.0**, establishing its advantage in semantic completeness and statement quality.

2. **Domestic Rising Star**: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp made its debut on the leaderboard with outstanding performance in "Domestic Database Conversion", showcasing reinforcement learning pre-training methods and providing new high-performance options for domestic scenarios.

## II. Evaluation Purpose and Methodology

The LLM SQL Capability Leaderboard aims to evaluate the rapidly growing SQL capabilities of major models! SCALE is committed to providing scientific and rigorous evaluations with comprehensive coverage, including three key capabilities: SQL optimization (models with strong optimization capabilities), dialect conversion (SQL translation and domestic database dialects), and SQL understanding (semantic completeness and key aspects), truly reflecting database modeling behavior.

## III. Leaderboard Analysis

### 3.1 Overall Capability Ranking

This evaluation includes 21 models. Here are the top three in overall capability:

1. **SQLFlash**: 88.50 points
2. **SQLShift**: 83.40 points
3. **Gemini 3 Pro**: 86.00 points (SQL Understanding Champion)

### 3.2 Champions by Dimension

- **SQL Optimization Champion**: SQLFlash (88.50)
- **Dialect Conversion Champion**: SQLShift (83.40)
- **SQL Understanding Champion**: Gemini 3 Pro (86.00)

## IV. In-depth Analysis of Key Models

### 4.1 Gemini 3 Pro

Gemini 3 Pro excels in the SQL understanding dimension, with its semantic understanding and query optimization capabilities reaching industry-leading levels.

**Key Features**:
- Powerful semantic understanding
- Precise SQL syntax detection
- Excellent execution plan analysis

### 4.2 DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp

The DeepSeek model shows impressive performance in domestic database conversion, particularly in handling complex SQL transformations.

**Key Features**:
- Excellent dialect conversion capability
- Deep optimization for domestic databases
- Reinforcement learning training methods

## V. Conclusion and Outlook

SCALE evaluation will continue to track the development of large models in the SQL domain, providing the most authoritative technical selection reference for users. We look forward to more excellent models joining us to jointly promote the development of database technology.
