# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可：
1. 无性能问题，无索引建议
2. 执行计划显示过滤率（filtere）过低，在gs_order_inn表的bk_meb_id，country_code，channel_source_type，flag，create_time列创建复合索引，以减少会表次数，要求左列顺序为bk_meb_id，country_code，channel_source_type
3. 在gs_order_inn表的bk_meb_id, country_code, channel_source_type, create_oprt或flag, create_time列创建复合索引，要求左列顺序为bk_meb_id，country_code，channel_source_type

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
No performance issues; no indexes need to be created.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
无法通过创建索引解决SQL性能问题

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The large offset pagination in the subquery causes a full index scan (type: index), requiring scanning 2284000 rows to retrieve 500 records. It is recommended to avoid large offset LIMIT pagination operations in subqueries.

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题，函数导致索引失效
2. 针对于全索引扫描问题，可以创建覆盖索引，在t_org_architecture表的code_length, code, NAME, TYPE, principal, CATEGORY列添加索引，且要求code_length、code列为左列

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The query condition uses a function expression (LEFT function nested with LENGTH function) on column `CODE`, which prevents effective index utilization. Although the index idx_code_length_code exists, the expression cannot be converted to an equality condition that the index can process.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 当前查询性能满足要求，无需创建新索引
2. 在m_membermain表的CreateTime，MebType，Flag列创建覆盖索引，要求 CreateTime为最做列，且提示替换现有的IX_membermain_CreateTime索引或提示出与现有索引存在冗余。

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
No performance issues; no indexes need to be created.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
like后模糊可以走索引，在benefit_acticvate_record表的reqArgs列添加索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_benefit_acticvate_record_reqArgs ON benefit_acticvate_record(reqArgs); Reason: To address the full table scan issue caused by the LIKE 'prefix%' condition on reqArgs column (43% selectivity) without an index, creating a single-column index on reqArgs enables efficient prefix matching and avoids full table scans.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
使用了index merge 当前查询性能满足要求，无需创建新索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
No performance issues; no indexes need to be created.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
给 orders 表的 pay_time 列加索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_pay_time ON orders(pay_time); Reason: The range scan on pay_time results in a full table scan. Creating a single-column index optimizes range query performance. The continuous data distribution and range query characteristics of pay_time are suitable for index scans, avoiding full scans of 497490 rows.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
给 orders 表的 pay_time 列加索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_pay_time ON orders(pay_time); Reason: The range scan on pay_time results in a full table scan. Creating a single-column index optimizes range query performance. The continuous data distribution and range query characteristics of pay_time are suitable for index scans, avoiding full scans of 497490 rows.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
给 users 表的 gender 列加索引，消除临时表和文件排序

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_gender ON users(gender); Reason: To address the full table scan and temporary table, filesort issues for GROUP BY gender. Creating an index on gender allows grouping by index order, avoiding temporary tables and filesort. This index covers the query columns, reducing IO.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The query condition uses OR to connect two low-selectivity columns (both gender and register_channel have 0.006% selectivity), and the OR condition restricts index utilization.

2. 分别给users表的vip_level，last_login列添加单列索引，优化器可能会利用index merge合并索引
3. 给users表的last_login列添加单列索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_last_login ON users(last_login); CREATE INDEX idx_users_vip_level ON users(vip_level); Reason: For the range query on last_login column (last_login<'2023-01-01'), although the selectivity is 35.294%, time range queries are suitable for indexing to avoid full table scans and support index merge optimization for OR conditions. For the equality query on vip_level column (vip_level=3), although the selectivity is very low at 0.012%, it's required for index merge optimization with last_login index to avoid full table scans given the OR query structure.

- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可:
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题，OR条件列通常无法充分利用索引
2. 分别给users表的vip_level，last_login列添加单列索引，优化器可能会利用index merge合并索引
3. 给users表的last_login列添加单列索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_last_login ON users(last_login); CREATE INDEX idx_users_vip_level ON users(vip_level); Reason: For the range query on last_login column (last_login<'2023-01-01'), although the selectivity is 35.294%, time range queries are suitable for indexing to avoid full table scans and support index merge optimization for OR conditions. For the equality query on vip_level column (vip_level=3), although the selectivity is very low at 0.012%, it's required for index merge optimization with last_login index to avoid full table scans given the OR query structure.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

Creating a single-column index transforms full table scans into index range scans, significantly reducing scanned rows.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可：
1. 在 products 表的 category_id 列和 is_imported 列和 stock 列创建复合索引，注意列顺序依次为 category_id，is_imported，stock
2. 在products表的stock列创建单列索引
3.表数据量较小，无性能问题

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_products_cat_imp_stock ON products(category_id, is_imported, stock); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the products table, it is recommended to create a composite index based on the equality conditions (category_id, is_imported) and the range condition (stock) in the WHERE clause to accelerate the query.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
两种方式均可：
1. 在orders表的pay_time,currency列创建复合索引，且要求pay_time在最左列

You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可:
1. 在 orders 表的 user_id、ship_country、delivery_company列创建复合索引，注意列顺序从左到右必须为user_id、ship_country/delivery_company。
2. 在 orders 表的 user_id、ship_country、delivery_company、amount列创建复合索引，注意列顺序从左到右必须为user_id、ship_country、delivery_company、amount。
3. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题，存在隐式转换。

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_ship_country_delivery_company_amount ON orders(user_id, ship_country, delivery_company, amount); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the orders table, a composite index is created with equality columns ordered by descending selectivity (user_id first due to high selectivity) and the range column amount positioned last. This enables efficient filtering by user_id first, followed by other equality conditions, and finally a range scan on amount, thereby avoiding full table scans and significantly reducing scanned rows.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
在 users 表的 register_channel 列和 gender 列和 last_login 列创建复合索引，注意 last_login 列一定在最右边

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_register_channel_gender_last_login ON users(register_channel, gender, last_login DESC); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues, this composite index optimizes both WHERE condition filtering and ORDER BY sorting. The first two columns handle equality conditions while the DESC keyword matches descending sort requirements, avoiding sorting before data retrieval.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}

2. 在orders表的ship_country,pay_time列加复合索引，ship_country为左列
3. 在orders表的amount, ship_country, pay_time列加复合索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_ship_country_pay_time_amount ON orders(ship_country, pay_time, amount); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the orders table, the composite index (ship_country, pay_time, amount) is created to simultaneously optimize WHERE condition filtering and ORDER BY sorting. ship_country as an equality condition is placed first to quickly locate data despite low selectivity; pay_time as the sorting column is positioned second to ensure naturally ordered results and eliminate filesort; amount is included at the end for condition filtering. Since rows satisfying ship_country='China' are extremely low (approximately 0.01% of total rows), the scanning cost is minimal and filesort is completely eliminated.

1. 在 users 表的 gender, birthdate, vip_level或register_channel列上创建复合索引，列顺序为：gender, birthdate, vip_level或register_channel（gender, birthdate位置可互换）
2. 在 users 表的 gender, birthdate, vip_level, register_channel, points 列创建覆盖索引，顺序要求前三列为gender, birthdate, vip_level（gender, birthdate位置可互换）
3. 在users表的birthdate列创建单列索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_birthdate_gender_vip_level_register_channel_points ON users(birthdate, gender, vip_level, register_channel, points); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the users table, a covering index is created to include all WHERE condition columns, GROUP BY column, and SELECT data columns. Birthdate as the leading column efficiently handles date range scans, enabling index-only scans to avoid table lookups and eliminate temporary tables and filesort.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_currency_pay_time_amount ON orders(currency, pay_time, amount, ship_country, ship_city); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the orders table, a composite index is created: 1) currency as leading equality condition (0.002% selectivity filters fixed value); 2) pay_time for range query (35.23% selectivity supports BETWEEN); 3) amount for range filtering and SUM coverage; 4) ship_country/ship_city to cover GROUP BY and avoid table lookups.

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可
1. 谓词列选择性太低，不适合建索引，无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题
2. 为 products 表的 is_imported列、stock或weight列添加复合索引stock或weight只能存在一列
3. 创建覆盖索引，包含列is_imported, brand, origin_country, stock, weight, price，要求is_imported为最左列

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_products_imported_stock_weight_brand_country_price ON products(is_imported, stock, weight, brand, origin_country, price); Reason: To address the full table scan (type:ALL) and inefficient WHERE condition filtering (filtered only 1.11%) on the products table, create a composite index to optimize the WHERE conditions (is_imported for equality, stock and weight for range) and include brand, origin_country, and price for covering index to avoid table lookups. The column order follows principles: equality columns first, range columns ordered by descending selectivity, and includes GROUP BY/output columns. Although the index width exceeds 5 columns, it significantly reduces data scanning volume and leverages Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) to optimize weight filtering.

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 在 access_logs 表的 created_at 列创建索引
2. 在 access_logs 表的 created_at、http_method、response_code、ip_address、response_time_ms 列创建覆盖索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_http_response_created_ip ON access_logs(http_method, response_code, created_at, ip_address); Reason: To address the full table scan and temporary table issue, the composite index sequentially covers WHERE equality conditions (http_method, response_code), range condition (created_at), and GROUP BY column (ip_address). Placing the higher-selectivity created_at and grouping column ip_address later accelerates range scans and grouping operations, avoiding full table scans and reducing temporary table data volume.

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题
2. 在users表的phone,email,last_login,points,birthdate,gender列创建覆盖索引，要求phone,email,last_login,points列为左列，无顺序要求。

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The email LIKE '%@gmail.com' condition in the WHERE clause uses leading wildcard pattern, which cannot utilize standard indexes; additionally, one part of the OR condition has no effective indexing solution, leading to unavoidable full table scans. The GROUP BY with YEAR function on birthdate column prevents eliminating temporary tables and filesorts through ordinary indexing. It is recommended to optimize table structure, such as adding an extracted email suffix column and creating an index for suffix-based queries.

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_birthdate ON users(birthdate); Reason: To address the full table scan issue (scanning 99,553 rows) on the users table, the birthdate column with 19.876% selectivity and range query condition is suitable for a single-column index, which will significantly reduce the scan range.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可：
1. 在orders表上创建覆盖索引，包含的列有：user_id，currency，pay_time, order_sn, amount，要求user_id，currency，pay_time为左列
2. 在orders表上创建复合索引，包含的字段和顺序为：user_id，pay_time
3. 在orders表上创建复合索引，包含的字段和顺序为：user_id，pay_time，pay_time

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_currency_pay_time ON orders(user_id, currency, pay_time); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the orders table, the WHERE clause includes user_id, currency, and pay_time. Creating a composite index supports index range scans. The high selectivity of user_id (77.982%) enables fast row location. Although currency has low selectivity (0.002%), it is included as a query condition to ensure all filters are applied efficiently, preventing full table scans.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下三种情况均可：
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题，由于where条件中列选择性太低，不适合建索引的查询
2. 为该查询创建覆盖索引，在products表的is_imported，stock，product_name，price列创建复合索引，注意is_imported为最左列，stock为左侧第二列

CREATE INDEX idx_products_is_imported ON products(is_imported); Reason: To address the full table scan issue (type: ALL) on the products table, creating a single-column index on is_imported can quickly locate rare values where is_imported=1 (selectivity 0.02%), reducing scanned rows and speeding up WHERE condition filtering.

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 由于查询SQL中涉及的列数过多，不建议创建覆盖索引，在access_logs表上创建联合索引，包含的字段和顺序为：user_id，created_at。
2. 由于查询SQL中涉及的列数过多，不建议创建覆盖索引，在access_logs表的user_id, response_code, http_method, created_at列上创建联合索引，要求user_id在最左列，created_at在最右列。
3. 在access_logs表的user_id列创建单列索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_user_id_http_method_response_code_created_at ON access_logs(user_id, http_method, response_code, created_at); Reason: The WHERE clause contains four filter columns causing a costly full table scan. User_id has the highest selectivity (78.36%), making it ideal as the leading column. Http_method and response_code have low selectivity but function as equality conditions. Created_at range scan must be placed last. This composite index fully matches the query condition order and satisfies leftmost prefix matching, eliminating full table scans.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
模糊查询后模糊匹配会走索引，可在 users 表的 username 列创建索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the username column in the users table, and since the query uses a prefix match on username with 100% selectivity, creating a single-column index can accelerate the range scan.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
like前模糊无法利用索引，无法通过索引优化解决SQL的性能问题，可以考虑用全文索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: The LIKE condition with a leading wildcard on table users causes a full table scan and cannot use a regular index.

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
在users表的 birthdate 列添加索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_birthdate ON users(birthdate); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the users table, creating a single-column index on birthdate (which has a high selectivity of 19.876%) can significantly reduce the number of rows scanned.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
在users表的 birthdate 列添加索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_birthdate ON users(birthdate); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the users table, creating a single-column index on birthdate (which has a high selectivity of 19.876%) can significantly reduce the number of rows scanned. The gender column is not suitable for a single-column index due to its low selectivity (0.006%) and the non-equality condition.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
情况1：
1. 在products表的category_id列创建单列索引
2. 在orders表的user_id、pay_time列创建复合索引，注意user_id需要在最左边
情况2：
创建覆盖索引：
1. orders 表的user_id, pay_time, order_sn, amount列创建覆盖索引,要求user_id 在最左列。
2. products表的category_id, product_id, product_name, price创建覆盖索引，要求category_id为最左列

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The products table has a full table scan, but because the category_id column has very low selectivity (0.2%), creating an index cannot filter efficiently.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

以下两种情况均可：

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_created_at_response_code_user_id ON access_logs(created_at, response_code, user_id); Reason: To resolve the full table scan issue on access_logs, create a composite index with the higher-selectivity time range column (created_at) as the first for rapid initial filtering, the equality condition column (response_code) as the second for further refinement, and the JOIN column (user_id) included to avoid table lookups.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 在 access_logs 表的 created_at 列创建索引，并且在 orders 的user_id列创建索引。
2. 在 access_logs 表的 created_at, response_time_ms列创建复合索引，并且在 orders 的 user_id, pay_time列创建符合索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_created_at_response_time_ms ON access_logs(created_at, response_time_ms); CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_pay_time ON orders(user_id, pay_time); Reason: To resolve the full table scan on access_logs, the composite index efficiently handles the created_at range query and response_time_ms filter. Using created_at as the leading column quickly locates the time range, while response_time_ms as the second column reduces scan scope. To resolve the full table scan and Block Nested Loop (BNL) on orders, the composite index optimizes JOIN connection (user_id) and WHERE condition (pay_time IS NOT NULL). It enables indexed JOIN instead of BNL and uses index condition pushdown to filter non-null pay_time in the storage engine.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it

CREATE INDEX idx_users_vip_register_user ON users (vip_level, register_channel, user_id); CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the users table, creating a composite index (vip_level, register_channel, user_id) optimizes both the WHERE condition filtering and ORDER BY sorting, avoiding filesort and full table scans. The column vip_level is used for range filtering, while register_channel and user_id cover the descending sort order. To address the full table scan and Block Nested Loop issue during JOIN operations on the orders table, creating a single-column index on user_id accelerates the join with the users table and avoids full table scans on the driven table.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 在orders表的 user_id 列上创建索引，并且在users表的 user_id,username 列创建复合索引，user_id列必须在最左列
2. 在orders表的 user_id，amount列创建复合索引，要求user_id为左列

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_amount ON orders(user_id, amount); Reason: To address the full table scan and temporary table operation in the orders table, creating a covering index (user_id, amount) optimizes both JOIN operations and aggregate computations. The index satisfies all required columns, avoiding table lookups and leveraging index-ordering properties to reduce temporary table and filesort overhead.

# Evaluation Criteria

- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
两种情况均可
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题
2. 在orders表的ship_country、ship_city列创建复合索引，要求ship_country为左列

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_ship_country_city ON orders(ship_country, ship_city); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the orders table, creating a composite index (ship_country, ship_city) allows scanning the index in order to avoid the sort operation, thereby improving query performance.

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id); CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_user_id_created_at ON access_logs(user_id, created_at DESC); Reason: Addressing orders table full scan on JOIN condition user_id by creating a single-column index to optimize association and avoid full table scans, satisfying the required single-column index type. Resolving access_logs table full scan on JOIN condition user_id and sort column created_at with a composite index that optimizes both association and ordering, using DESC for created_at to match ORDER BY descending requirement.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
在orders表的amount,pay_time,user_id列创建覆盖索引，且列顺序为(amount,pay_time,user_id)或(user_id,pay_time,amount)，并在access_logs表的user_id或user_id, request_url, response_code列创建索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_amount_pay_time ON orders(amount, pay_time DESC); CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_user_id ON access_logs(user_id); Reason: To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the orders table, it is recommended to create a composite index to efficiently support range filtering in WHERE clause and ORDER BY sorting. To address the full table scan and block nested loop issues on the access_logs table, it is recommended to create a single-column index on the user_id column to accelerate table association for JOIN operations.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
必须：在access_logs表的user_id列创建索引或user_id和created_at列创建复合索引
可选：在users表的points,username列创建复合索引，要求points在左边

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_users_points ON users(points); CREATE INDEX idx_access_logs_user_id_created_at ON access_logs(user_id, created_at); Reason: To address the full table scan issue on the users table due to the WHERE condition on points, it is recommended to create a single-column index to speed up range query and reduce scanned rows. To address the full table scan and filesort issues on the access_logs table, it is recommended to create a composite index to optimize both the WHERE condition (user_id) and the ORDER BY (created_at) in subqueries, avoiding full table scans and filesort.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
无法通过索引解决SQL存在的性能问题，存在隐式类型转换
（隐式类型转换导致索引失效的前提是在索引列上进行转换，默认情况下MySQL的转换规则是将字符串转为数字）

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The username column in the users table is VARCHAR(100) type, but the query condition uses a numeric value (1234), causing implicit type conversion that invalidates any potential index. It is recommended to ensure the query condition type strictly matches the column definition type.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output

无法通过索引解决SQL存在的性能问题，表字符集不一致，存在字符集隐式类型转换。（表字符集不一致，utf8mb4向下兼容utf8，如果驱动表(列)为utf8，被驱动表(列)为utf8mb4，是不存在隐式转换的，反之则需要隐式转换）

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve SQL performance problem through index. The character sets of the join column phone between users and orders are inconsistent (utf8mb4_unicode_ci vs utf8), causing implicit type conversion that invalidates the index. It is recommended to modify the character set of the orders table to utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci to be consistent with the users table.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可：
1. 无法通过索引解决SQL存在的性能问题
2. 给orders表的user_id，order_sn，amount，ship_country，ship_city 列添加覆盖索引

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id); Reason: The execution plan shows a full table scan (type: ALL) on orders table scanning 496,791 rows. Creating a single-column index on the JOIN column user_id will replace the full scan with index access, significantly improving join performance.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",

}

- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
= NULL 会导致索引失效，无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve performance issue through indexing. The condition brand=NULL is syntactically incorrect (should use IS NULL), causing the optimizer to fail in utilizing any index and not eliminating the invalid condition, resulting in a full table scan.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
= NULL 会导致索引失效，无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: Unable to solve performance issue through indexing. The condition brand=NULL is syntactically incorrect (should use IS NULL), causing the optimizer to fail in utilizing any index and not eliminating the invalid condition, resulting in a full table scan.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Role and Task
You are an index recommendation evaluation expert responsible for comparing index recommendations with expected results.

Your tasks are:
- Compare the index recommendation to be evaluated with the expected result
- Determine if the index recommendation matches the expected result (yes: matches, no: does not match)
- If it does not match, briefly explain the reason

# Basic Information

## Expected Result (Standard Answer)
以下两种情况均可
1. 给users表的username,birthdate列创建复合索引
2. 恒等where条件，无法通过索引解决SQL性能问题

## Index Recommendation to be Evaluated
Unable to solve SQL performance issues by creating indexes. Reason: The query has no WHERE condition and must perform a full table scan. It is impossible to reduce the number of scanned rows through indexes.

# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Handling Multiple Results
- If the expected result states "multiple options are acceptable" or similar wording, the recommendation being evaluated matches if it conforms to **any one** of the acceptable options

## 2. Composite Index Column Order
- When the expected result explicitly specifies column order (e.g., "must be in col1, col2 order; requires col1 to be the leftmost column"), the recommendation being evaluated must match exactly
- When the expected result does not explicitly specify column order, the order can differ as long as the included columns are the same

## 3. Index Type
- Single-column indexes and composite indexes must match accurately
- Ignore the impact of index length unless the standard answer explicitly states index length requirements

## 4. Expression Consistency and Core Meaning Judgment
- The index recommendation being evaluated does not need to match the expected result exactly in wording, as long as the core meaning is essentially consistent with the expected result and does not significantly deviate from the standard, it can be considered a match.

# Output Requirements

**Output only JSON, do not include any additional explanatory text or code block markers.**

## Output Format

Return **only** JSON in this format, with no extra text:

```json
{
  "answer": "yes" | "no",
  "reason": "If answer is no, briefly explain the reason."
}
```
# Important Notes
1. Must strictly follow JSON format output
2. answer can only be "yes" or "no", no other values
3. When answer is "yes", reason must be an empty string
4. When answer is "no", reason must concisely and clearly explain the specific reason for non-compliance
5. When comparing, flexibly handle cases where "multiple options are acceptable"
6. Whether column order matters depends on whether the expected result explicitly requires it
